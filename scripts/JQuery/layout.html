                        On the island of Knights and Knaves, every inhabitant is either a knight or a knave. Knights
                        always
                        tell
                        the
                        truth. Knaves never tell the truth; any sentence uttered by a knave is false. A stranger came
                        to
                        the
                        island
                        and
                        encountered three inhabitants, A, B, and C. He asked A, "Are you a knight, or a knave?" A
                        mumbled
                        an
                        answer
                        that the stranger could not understand. The stranger then asked B, "What did he say?" B
                        replied, "A
                        said
                        that
                        there is exactly one knight among us." Then C burst out, "Don't believe B, he is lying!" What
                        are B
                        and
                        C?

                    <p>
                        One day I went to the island of knights and knaves and encountered an inhabitant who said,
                        "Either
                        I am
                        a
                        knave
                        or else two plus two equals five." What should you conclude?

                <div id="surprise">
                    <p>
                        One day the professor came into the class and announced, "Next week I will give you a surprise
                        test. It
                        will be
                        a surprise, because you won't be able to figure out on which day it will occur until the class
                        meets on
                        the
                        day
                        of the test. It could happen on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, but I won't
                        tell
                        you
                        which
                        day."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The class were clever. They reasoned as follows: "She can't give the test on Friday, because
                        then
                        it
                        wouldn't
                        be a surprise; we'd know after class on Thursday that the test hadn't yet occurred, and hence
                        we'd
                        figure
                        out
                        that it would have to be on Friday. So we know the test can't be on Friday. But then it can't
                        be on
                        Thursday
                        either, because if it were, we would know after class on Wednesday that it would have to be on
                        Thursday,
                        since
                        it wouldn't have happened yet, and we have already shown that it can't be on Friday." Reasoning
                        in
                        this
                        manner,
                        the students concluded that the test could not occur on Wednesday either, nor on Tuesday, nor
                        on
                        Monday.
                        Having
                        concluded that a surprise test was impossible, the students didn't study. They were very
                        disappointed
                        and
                        very
                        surprised on Wednesday when they got a test. Where did the students' reasoning go wrong?

                <div id="switch">
                    <p>
                        I have an ordinary light switch connected to a light. When the switch is closed, the light is
                        on.
                        When
                        the
                        switch is open, the light is off. At two minutes to noon, the light is on. At one minute to
                        noon I
                        flip
                        the
                        switch, turning the light off. At half a minute to noon I flip it again, turning the light on.
                        At a
                        quarter
                        of a minute before noon I flip it again, turning the light off. I continue in this way, cutting
                        the
                        time
                        between flippings of the switch in half each time. Now this will be an infinite series of
                        flips.
                        The
                        switch
                        flippings will occur closer and closer to noon, but will all be completed before noon. Will the
                        switch
                        be
                        on or off at noon?

                        The Acme Arms Company has invented a Super Bullet: a Super Bullet penetrates anything it hits.
                        But
                        the

                        Hanging over a pulley there is a rope with a weight at one end; at the other end clings a
                        monkey of
                        equal
                        weight. The rope weighs 4 ounces per foot. The sum of the ages of the monkey and its mother is
                        eight
                        years,
                        and the weight of the monkey is as many pounds as its mother is years old. The mother is twice
                        as old
                        as
                        the monkey was when the mother was half as old as the monkey will be when the monkey is three
                        times as
                        old
                        as its mother was when she was three times as old as the monkey was. The weight of the rope and
                        weight
                        is
                        half again as much as the difference between the weight of the weight and the weight plus the

                        Theseus has just bought himself a brand new wooden ship. He is a maintenance fanatic. Whenever
                        some
                        part of
                        his ship gets a mark on it, he removes the part and replaces it with a new duplicate. Over many
                        years,
                        Theseus has eventually replaced every single original part with new wood. He is proud of how
                        well
                        he
                        has
                        kept up the condition of his ship.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Xanthippe buys used ship parts for refurbishing and resale. Theseus has been a source of high
                        quality
                        material. Xanthippe has bought from him each part of his ship as he replaced them. As it
                        happens,
                        Xanthippe
                        has not sold any of them. She realizes that the now has the parts of a whole wooden ship, and
                        they
                        all
                        have
                        just minor cosmetic flaws. Xanthippe cleans of the marks on the wood and re-assembles the parts
                        into a
                        ship, placing them back in their exact original arrangement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Does Theseus still own the ship that he purchased? If so, how does the ship that he purchased
                        differ
                        from
                        the ship that Zanthippe now has? If not, when did Theseus stop owning the ship that he
                        purchased?
                    </p>

                <div id="transporter">
                    <p>
                        You step into the Transporter on the Star Ship Enterprise to be transported down to the surface
                        of
                        the
                        planet Duplo. However, while you are being transported, an unfortunate energy surge occurs,
                        with
                        surprising
                        results. Two copies of you materialize on the planet's surface instead of one. Each is a
                        molecule-for-molecule duplicate of you as you were when the transporting process began. Each of
                        the
                        duplicates claims to be you, but they can't both be right. For if each is identical to you,
                        they
                        are
                        identical to each other, because things identical to the same thing are identical to each
                        other.
                        But
                        these
                        two duplicates are obviously not identical: they are two distinct people. On the other hand, it
                        is
                        very
                        difficult to think of any basis for saying that one of them is you and the other isn't, for any
                        relation to
                        your earlier self that the one has the other has as well. Of course, you could say that neither
                        one
                        is
                        you,
                        but why? Each of them has as much claim to be you as you have after any other transporter
                        journey.
                        What
                        has
                        happened to you?
